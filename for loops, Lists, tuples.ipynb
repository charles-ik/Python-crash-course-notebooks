    "# Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples in Python are ordered collections of elements enclosed in parentheses (). \n",
    "\n",
    "They are **immutable**, meaning their elements cannot be modified once assigned.   \n",
    "Tuples can contain elements of different data types, and their elements are accessed using indexing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a Tuple\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 'a', 'b', 'c')\n",
    "```  \n",
    "### Accessing Elements  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Elements in a tuple are accessed using indexing, starting from 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "print(my_tuple[0])  # Output: 1\n",
    "print(my_tuple[3])  # Output: 'a'\n",
    "```  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Immutable Nature  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Tuples cannot be modified directly.   \n",
    "\n",
    "**However, if an element within a tuple is mutable, its internal state can be changed.**\n",

    "### Tuple Packing and Unpacking  \n",
    "\n",
    "Tuple packing is the process of **creating a tuple by assigning multiple values to a single variable.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Tuple unpacking **allows assigning elements of a tuple to multiple variables.**\n",
    "\n",

    "### Concatenating Tuples  \n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples can be concatenated **using the + operator to create a new tuple.**\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Use Cases  \n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples are useful when you want **to represent a collection of related elements that should not be modified.**  \n",
    "They are commonly used to group multiple values together, such as coordinates, database records, or function return values.\n",
    "\n",
