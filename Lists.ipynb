    "\n",
    "#### [start:end:step]\n",
    "\n",
    "- start denotes the index of the first element to include (inclusive).\n",
    "- end represents the index of the first element to exclude (exclusive).\n",
    "- step defines the interval between elements to include (optional).\n",

    "## Basic Slicing\n",
    "\n",
    "extract a **contiguous range of elements from a list**. (this is elements that are **consecutive and appear in sequential order** within the list.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "sliced_list = my_list[1:4]\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Sliced_list contains elements at indices 1, 2, and 3 from my_list.\n",
    "- The slicing notation [1:4] selects elements starting from index 1 up to, but not including, index 4. \n",
    "- **result will be [2, 3, 4]**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advanced Slicing\n",
    "\n",
    "Negative Indices\n",
    "\n",
    "Slicing notation supports negative indices, allowing you to **count positions from the end of the list**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "sliced_list = my_list[-3:-1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Sliced_list contains elements at indices -3 and -2 from my_list. \n",
    "- Negative indices count from the end, so -3 refers to the third-to-last element, and -1 refers to the second-to-last element. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Result will be [3, 4].**\n",
    "\n",
    "To include the second-to-last element, you can modify the slicing notation as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "sliced_list = my_list[-3:]\n",
    "#output [3, 4, 5]\n",
    "```\n",
    "## Step Size  \n",
    "\n",
    "The step size allows you to **skip elements in the list while slicing**.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's examine an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "sliced_list = my_list[::2]\n",
    "```\n",
    "- In this example, sliced_list will contain every second element from my_list. \n",
    "- The slicing notation [::2] instructs the slice to start at the beginning and select every second element. \n",
    "- **Result will be [1, 3, 5].**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reversing a List\n",
    "Slicing notation can also be used to reverse the order of a list. Take a look at the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "reversed_list = my_list[::-1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "- By using [::-1] as the slicing notation, reversed_list will contain all elements of my_list in reverse order. \n",
    "- The negative step value -1 indicates that the list should be traversed in reverse.   \n",
    "- **Result will be [5, 4, 3, 2, 1].**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Slicing Strings\n",
    "Slicing notation can also be applied to strings, treating them as lists of characters. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "my_string = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "sliced_string = my_string[7:12]\n",
    "```\n",
    "- In this example, sliced_string will contain the characters at indices 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 from my_string. \n",
    "- The slicing notation [7:12] selects characters starting from index 7 up to, but not including, index 12. \n",
    "- **Result will be \"World\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "By utilizing slicing notation in Python, you can precisely extract portions of lists based on indices, reverse lists, and even slice strings.\n",
    "The flexibility it offers makes it a powerful tool for manipulating and accessing data within lists."
